# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline $inc Operator Error
This repository demonstrates an incorrect usage of the `$inc` operator within a MongoDB aggregation pipeline. The `$inc` operator is used to increment a numerical field by a specified value. However, in this example, an array is passed as the argument, resulting in an error.

## Bug Description
The issue arises from attempting to increment the `count` field using an array with `$inc`. The `$inc` operator only accepts a single numerical value.

## Solution
The correct approach involves directly incrementing the `count` field without using an array.
